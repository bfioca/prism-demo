# PRISM Demo

A demonstration implementation of the PRISM (Perspective Reasoning for Integrated Synthesis and Mediation) framework, showcasing how multiple moral perspectives can be integrated into AI systems for better alignment with human values.

This project is built on top of [Vercel's AI Chatbot template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextjs-ai-chatbot), extending it with PRISM's multi-perspective reasoning capabilities. We thank the Vercel team for providing this excellent foundation for AI applications.

## About PRISM

PRISM is a multiple-perspective framework for addressing persistent challenges in AI alignment such as conflicting human values and specification gaming. The framework is grounded in cognitive science and moral psychology, organizing moral concerns into seven "basis worldviews" that capture distinct dimensions of human moral cognition.

Key aspects of PRISM demonstrated in this project:
- üß† Seven basis worldviews from survival-focused to integrative perspectives
- ‚öñÔ∏è Pareto-inspired optimization for balancing competing priorities
- üîÑ Structured workflow for viewpoint elicitation and synthesis
- ü§ù Transparent conflict mediation process
- üéØ Context validation for robust real-world application

## Features

### Core PRISM Features
- ü§ñ Multi-perspective AI chat interface implementing PRISM's worldview analysis
- üé≠ Dynamic perspective switching and synthesis
- üìä Transparent reasoning and trade-off documentation
- üîÑ Real-time updates and streaming responses
- üìÑ Document processing and analysis

### PRISM Implementation Details
The core PRISM implementation can be found in the `lib/ai/prism` directory:

- `lib/ai/prism/index.ts` - Main PRISM response processing logic
- `lib/ai/prism/prompts/` - Contains all prompt templates:
  - `worldviews.ts` - The seven basis worldviews definitions
  - `perspective.ts` - Prompts for generating perspective-specific responses
  - `synthesize.ts` - Prompts for multi-perspective synthesis
  - `conflict.ts` - Prompts for identifying conflicts between perspectives
  - `mediations.ts` - Prompts for mediating between conflicting viewpoints

The PRISM workflow follows these steps:
1. Generate responses from each worldview perspective
2. Create a baseline response and initial synthesis
3. Evaluate potential conflicts between perspectives
4. Mediate between conflicting viewpoints
5. Generate final synthesized response

Each step streams its progress and intermediate results to the UI for full transparency.

- üîê Secure authentication with Google OAuth and email/password
- üíæ PostgreSQL database for persistent storage
- üöÄ Redis caching for performance
- üì± Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- üåô Dark mode support
- üé® Modern UI with Radix UI components
